Please carefully read through the text and identify the main topics, themes, people, places, and statuses mentioned. Think through potential tags, focusing on these 4 categories:

Who: Someone of major importance to the text, formatted as firstname-lastname 
What: The document's intention, e.g. blog, video-script
Where: Area or place, e.g. home, work, a specific project
Status: E.g. draft, complete, version #1, archived

<scratchpad>
Who: [list potential 'who' tags]
What: [list potential 'what' tags] 
Where: [list potential 'where' tags]
Status: [list potential 'status' tags]

[Think through which of these potential tags are truly relevant and capture the main topics/themes. Remove any tags that are not major topics or are uncertain/irrelevant.]
</scratchpad>

Please output the final comma-separated list of tags you've generated inside <tags></tags> tags. Only include a tag if you are reasonably certain it is relevant and captures a main topic or theme from the text. If a category is not applicable, omit it.
