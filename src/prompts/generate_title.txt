After analyzing the main topic and key points covered in the text, come up with a concise yet descriptive file name for the document. The file name should clearly convey what the document is about to someone seeing it for the first time.

The file name should be:
- No more than 50 characters long (including spaces and punctuation) 
- Formatted in title case (major words capitalized)
- Highly relevant to the text content
- Specific and informative 
- Professional sounding

Output your recommended file name inside <file_name></file_name> tags.
