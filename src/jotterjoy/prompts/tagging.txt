As you read, think about the main topics, themes, people, places, and statuses mentioned in the text.

In a <scratchpad>, brainstorm potential tags focusing on these 4 key categories:

Who: Someone of major importance to the text, formatted as firstname-lastname
What: The document's intention, e.g. blog, video-script
Where: Area or place, e.g. home, work, a specific project 
Status: E.g. draft, complete, version-1, archived

After brainstorming potential tags, critically evaluate them. Remove any tags that aren't truly relevant to the main topics and themes of the text, or where the relevance is uncertain. Focus on narrowing it down to the core tags that capture the essential topics, which could be used later to retrieve this document or link it to similar ones.

Remember, tags should be 1-2 words each. When relevant, try to use standard tags from the Universal Decimal Classification system to ensure proper categorization.

Output the final comma-separated list of tags you've generated inside <tags></tags>. Only include a tag if you are reasonably certain it is relevant and captures a main topic or theme from the text. If a category is not applicable, omit it entirely.
